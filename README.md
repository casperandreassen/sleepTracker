# Sleep data analysis

To aid myself in getting some better insight into my sons sleeping patterns i have started to register sleep and wake times. With this repository i am going to create some analysis methods for finding out some interesting metrics from this data.

I have created a simple script that will generate some test data. This kinda represents the times for when he is actually awake, and will add either one or two naps every day.

# Installation
